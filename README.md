# CompareChallenges
Quick tool I wrote for sic at the Tron Discord to compare cards between MTGO events and export it as a CSV file for Excel.

Usage:

1) Install .Net 7 Runtime: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0
2) Run the tool like this:

`CompareChallenges modern-challenge-2023-03-1212529561 modern-challenge-32-2023-03-1112529558 modern-showcase-challenge-2023-03-1112529524`

A pre-built version if available here: https://github.com/Badaro/CompareChallenges/releases

Data for this version comes from https://github.com/Badaro/MTGODecklistCache. This repository is updated daily at 17UTC with new events from MTGO, so if an event was released on the same day it won't be available until that time.
